# Would You Rather Project

This is the final assessment project submitted for [Udacity's React & Redux course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). The project was developed on [starter template provided by Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-would-you-rather-starter). The goal of this project was to acheive these results:
* Match the criteria provided in the project specification of this course
* Using ESLint standard code styling
* Creating new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed
* Commenting on code where required

Obviously, anyone can play around with this project but if trying to get React Nanodegree, please complete the project before looking into this code.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Running the Project

To run this project right away:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* Start the development server with `npm start`

## Troubleshooting

All required dependencies are already specified. Make sure you have `npm` and `create-react-app` packages installed on your machine.

## What's Included

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let app access the data.

### Data

There are two types of objects stored in the database:

* Users
* Questions

#### Users

Users include:

| Attribute    | Type             | Description           |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------         |
| id                 | String           | The user’s unique identifier |
| name          | String           | The user’s first name  and last name     |
| avatarURL  | String           | The path to the image file |
| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.

#### Questions

Questions include:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| id                  | String | The question’s unique identifier |
| author        | String | The author’s unique identifier |
| timestamp | String | The time when the question was created|
| optionOne | Object | The first voting option|
| optionTwo | Object | The second voting option|

#### Voting Options

Voting options are attached to questions. They include:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| votes             | Array | A list that contains the id of each user who voted for that option|
| text                | String | The text of the option |

This code will be talking to the database via 4 methods:

* `_getUsers()`
* `_getQuestions()`
* `_saveQuestion(question)`
* `_saveQuestionAnswer(object)`

1) `_getUsers()` Method

*Description*: Get all of the existing users from the database.  
*Return Value*: Object where the key is the user’s id and the value is the user object.

2) `_getQuestions()` Method

*Description*: Get all of the existing questions from the database.  
*Return Value*: Object where the key is the question’s id and the value is the question object.

3) `_saveQuestion(question)` Method

*Description*: Save the polling question in the database.  
*Parameters*:  Object that includes the following properties: `author`, `optionOneText`, and `optionTwoText`. More details about these properties:

| author | String | The id of the user who posted the question|
| optionOneText| String | The text of the first option |
| optionTwoText | String | The text of the second option |

|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| id | String | The id of the question that was posted|
| author | String | The id of the user who posted the question|
